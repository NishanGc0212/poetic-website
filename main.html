        She walked by  
        like a season that never asked to stay 
        just left warmth  
        on everything quiet.  

        I said nothing.  
        But the air did.  
        The curtains moved  
        even when the wind didn’t.  

        She saw me once—  
        through the stairs,  
        and ran.  

        She never knew  
        that from that very moment,  
        I began to love her.  

        Not loudly.  
        Just like clocks love time
        always,  
        but never asking why.  

        I never said a word.  
        Not because I didn’t want to…  
        but because I didn’t know how.  

        What if she said no?  
        What if I lost  
        even her shadow?  

        So I kept it 
        folded in the hush  
        between her footsteps  
        and mine.  

        But now,  
        maybe now,  
        I will tell her.  

        Because love like this  
        was never meant  
        to be buried  
        in fear.
